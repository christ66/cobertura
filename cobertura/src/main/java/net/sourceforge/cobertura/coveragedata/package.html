    A hierarchy of classes used for storing metadata about each of your
    classes. A ProjectData object contains PackageData objects which
    contain ClassData objects
    which contain LineData objects. Or, in bad ASCII art:

<p>
    ProjectData <--> PackageData <--> ClassData <--> LineData
</p>

    The SourceFileData class is not used during instrumention or
    testing. It is a only used when generating the reports. Basically
    it's used to lump a set of classes together when those classes come
    from the same file. This is needed because the HTML reporting
    displays an entire file at a time, instead of displaying a single
    class at a time.
